# EquationsSolver
This Equations Solver project was done using the MATLAB programming language.  
Given a function of any type, a method of several root finding methods is chosen to solve the equation.  
Graphs are used to display function to be solved along with graphs to show the comparisons between methods performance.  
Errors in calculations, error bounds, maximum number of iterations, and couple other parameters are displayed.  
Supported Methods are Bisection Method, Newton Rapshon, Fixed Point, False Position, Secant, Birge Vieta (for polynomials), General Method (for multiple roots).
